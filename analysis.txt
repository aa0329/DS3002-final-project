After calling the API every minute for an hour and exporting that data to a database, 
I noticed that the factor variable seemed to be the cube of the current index it was on (besides 0). 
To test this theory, I made an analysis.py file where I made an array of cubes based on the index and
then compared it to the output of the factors column. It returned true for every single element. I think
the reason for this pattern is that the API looks at the minute the API was called and decides the factor
based on that (i.e. if the API was called at minute 2, the factor would be 8 or 2^3). I also noticed that 
PI seemed to be getting closer and closer to its actual value as time went on, so I also tested this in analysis.py
where I subtracted each pi value in the table from actual pi and saw that the difference got closer and closer to zero
as time went on.
